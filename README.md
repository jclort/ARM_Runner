# ARM Runner

ARM Simulation runner for 64 bit

**To implement a new instruction:**
1. Consult Mark Redman
2. If he does not respond, consult Jeffrey Lort
3. If all else fails, consult Greg Silber
4. If he doesn't respond, delete the codebase


Here are all of the resources I (Mark) have been looking through, in case you have the time to look and see if I'm looking in the right places.

Here is a little Javascript assembly simulator I stumbled upon.
